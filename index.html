            ### Why Build Web Applications?

            * Wealth of open-source libraries and tools
            * Easy to run the whole stack locally
                - no reliance on heavy system dependencies that are difficult to isolate
                - no need to rely on shared internal infrastructure
            * Increases developer productivity
                - allows for rapid development of new features
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            Always good to try new things!

            ### Goal of this Talk

            * Understand how modern web apps are structured
            * Get an introduction to some frameworks and libraries which can implement these apps
            * Walkthrough an example application
                - React application
                - backed by Node API
          </section>

          <section data-markdown data-notes="
There will some live coding in this presentation, but it'll be kept to a minimum.

The core focus of this talk is explaining the high-level process of building a modern web app, which leaves less time for interactive coding.

But don't worry, there'll still be plenty of code examples, and there'll be
example repos to look at after the ta;k.
">
            ### Scope

            * Building a web application using a modern architecture
            * Code examples given, but focus is on high-level process
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Pre-requisites

            * Intermediate knowledge of JavaScript
            * Understanding of:
                - how web pages work (i.e. HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
                - service-orientated architectures
                - and a little bit about cloud computing

            SAPs are becoming the standard approach in web dev.

            Building SAPs will be the focus of this talk.

          <section data-markdown data-notes="
Mention AirBnB for example of SAP affecting performance.

SEO -- An application that can only run in the client-side cannot serve HTML to crawlers, so it will have poor SEO by default. Web crawlers function by making a request to a web server and interpreting the result; but if the server returns a blank page, it’s not of much value. There are workarounds, but not without jumping through some hoops.

Responsiveness -- users will experience a few critical seconds of blank page or loading spinner before seeing the content on the page.

Maintainability -- while the ideal case can lead to a nice, clean separation of concerns, inevitably some bits of application logic or view logic end up duplicated between client and server, often in different languages. Common examples are date and currency formatting, form validations, and routing logic. This makes maintenance a nightmare, especially for more complex apps.

            ### Web App (Client &amp; Server)

            Many popular frameworks:

            * AngularJs
            * Meteor
            * Backbone
            * React
            * etc.

            **React** will be used for this workshop
          </section>

          <section data-markdown data-notes="
Done right, React components become well encapsulated building blocks that you
can reuse in many other applications.
">
            ### React

            ![react](images/react.svg)

            * open-source JavaScript UI framework
            * developed by Facebook
            * separates a web page into *components*
                - combined into a hierarchy and rendered
            * become popular amongst many heavy-hit web apps
                - *Instagram, AirBnB, Salesforce, Wolfram Alpha*
          </section>

          <section data-markdown data-notes="
MVC, or model-view-controller, is a way of architecting interfaces in a way that
separates the three primary concerns of a UI. These are:

  - the model -- the underlying data stored
  - the controller -- contains the business logic that retrieves/processes the
                      underlying data and handles user interaction by changing
                      model/view state
  - the view -- takes the processed data and displays it the user, giving the
                user interactive controls that talk to the controller
">
            ### Model-View Controller

            ![mvc](images/mvc.svg)
          </section>

          <section data-markdown data-notes="
It doesn't make sense to directly compare React with other, more complete
opionated frameworks, such as AngularJs and Backbone.

So if it's just the view, why are so many people raving about it?
">
            ### React is not an MVC framework

            * the V in MVC
            * but it's not just a HTML template engine
                - HTML templates just generate textual markup
            * React uses the **virtual DOM**
                - its own lightweight representation of a doc
            * virtual DOM is build from React **components**
                - isolated, testable view components
                - which handle their own state
          </section>

          <section data-markdown data-notes="
React being just the view also makes this workshop a bit easier, since it means
I can greatly simplify the server-side and model logic for brevity.
">
            ### Why React?

            * React uses its virtual DOM for rendering
                - does not depend on browsers
                - allows page to be rendered on the client and server
                - making it easier to build isomorphic apps
            * React components are easily testable
            * done right, components will also be reusable
            * free to use whatever you want for the model/controller
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Server

            * can use any language
            * but we're building an isomorphic app
            * requires ability to render HTML on client and server
            * duplicating render logic won't scale
            * unless we use **JavaScript** for the back-end
                - share React render code!

            * React single page application
            * web server to render initial page and send it to browser
                - along with the React app code

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Steps

            1. Build single page application
            2. Serve it as an isomorphic app
            3. Implement `twitterSearchApi`

            ### The DOM

            ![dom](images/dom.svg)
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### In a Nutshell

            ##### Initial Render

            * Represent page elements using virtual DOM
            * Defines an initial state for each page element
            * Use virtual DOM to render actual HTML
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### In a Nuthshell

            ##### Stage Changes

            * When state of a component changes:
                - re-render entire virtual DOM
                - very fast
            * Diff old and new virtual DOMs
                - use diff to compute minimum set of HTML DOM changes to render
                  the new state
            * Apply changes to render new state in the browser
          </section>

          <section data-markdown data-notes="
The main problem is that DOM was never optimized for creating dynamic UI.

We can work with it using JavaScript and libraries like jQuery (thanks God we have it). But jQuery and others did little to solve performance issues.

Think about modern social networks like Twitter, Facebook or Pinterest. After scrolling a little bit, user will have tens of thousands of nodes. Interact with them efficiently is a huge problem. Try to move a 1000 divs 5 pixel left for example. It may take more then a second. It's a lot of time for modern web. You can optimize the script and use some tricks, but in the end, it's a pain to work with huge pages and dynamic UI.

          <section data-markdown>
            ### The Virtual DOM

            * React's local and simplified copy of the HTML DOM
            * Can render HTML without browser DOM
            * Allows for both client and server side rendering using the same code
            * Rendering the virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the HTML DOM
          </section>

          <section data-markdown data-notes="
If the state of any element in the virtual DOM is modified, then the entire
React app will be rendered.

We then compute which elements are different, as shown in this second column.

We use the virtual DOM diff to compute the minimum set of browser DOM changes,
and apply those changes.

Now the state change is reflected in the client's browser.

            ### Building Blocks

            * `ReactElement`
            * `ReactNode`
            * `ReactComponent`
          </section>

Emphasise that this rendering is done on the browser, as it directly inserts the
rendered HTML DOM elements into an existing DOM element on the page.
">
            `ReactElement` &mdash; [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/tf55qk5f/)

            Lowest type in the virtual DOM, similar to an XML element.

            These can represent complex UI components.

            ```js
let props = { id: 'root-container' };
let children = 'just text, but can be list of child elements';

You can use React using only ReactElements but to really take advantage of React,
you'll want to use ReactComponents to create encapsulations with embedded state.

If you've used Angular before, then I'd say a React component is similar to an
Angular directive. They're essentially custom elements which manage their own
state and update the view as necessary.

If your component generates different outputs for the same combination of props

tested and resused.

            Props and state both:

            * plain JS objects

            ### Which to Use?

            If a component needs to alter one of its attributes

            that attribute should be part of its **state**

            otherwise it should just be a **prop** for that component.

            * we have a heavy client, a single page app
            * routing will take place on the client
            * `browserHistory` will:
                - intercept browser URL
                - render correct component
                - *without* sending new request to server
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            We define all components, routes and the router on the client, as
            shown before.

            Then we render the correct route into HTML like so:

            ```js
// after important all top-level components and setting up router...

// Use current URL to render correct components.
// Inject rendered components into the 'app-view' HTML DOM element.

render(router, document.getElementById('app-view'));

                - using imported libraries
            * this code will be bundled into **one JavaScript file**
            * browser requests that one file

            * bundle React web application into `bundle.js` file
                - webpack
            * server file statically
            * create small web server to render initial state of page
                - and serve static `bundle.js` file

            * node service with single endpoint:
                - `/api/search` &mdash; search for tweets matching supplied query
            * will search using Twitter's own search API
            * service is just a thin wrapper around Twitter's API

import express from 'express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.use('/api/search', require('./routes/search'));

const port = process.env.PORT || 8080;
app.listen(port, function() {
    console.log('Started twittersearchapi on port #{port}')
});

We're not going to dive into the details of how the /api/search endpoint uses
the Twitter API to search for tweets. The focus of this presentation is building
an isomorphic app, and this would just distract us from that focus.

There's plenty of resources online to teach you how to use the Twitter API, and
you can read the code for twitterSearchApi Node service, which is available
the same GitHub repo as this talk.

             /api/search

import { Router } from 'express';
import Config from '../../config.js';

const router = Router();

function search(query) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // twitter search API calls go here
  });
}

router.post('/', function(req, res) {
  if (query) {
    search(query).then(function(tweets) {
      res.status(200).json({ tweets: tweets });
    }, function (err) {
      res.status(500).json({ error: err });

            React is a JavaScript-based UI framework.

            Build components which manages a specific widget on the screen
            render elements on page and also manage.

            Components are isolated, reusable and testable units, whose details
            are abstracted from the real browser DOM.
